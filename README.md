## Tech used

* Express
* React.js
<!-- 
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Passport.js
* Google Auth 2.0
* Handlebars
* Materialize
* FontAwesome

-->

## Optimizations / Improvements

- Use React Router?
- useContext vs Redux to manage state?
- CSS / layout, maybe use Materialize or other framework
- Database such as MongoDB or Postgres
- Authentication
  - Users
  - Admin

## Lessons Learned

* Decision must be made whether Event Admin belongs in the same repo/same set of code as User Reg.
* Similarly, should Exhibitor admin be separate?
